## 📘 Projects Overview

### 🧠 [1. Government Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/reddylaxman/data-analytics-projects/tree/main/1.%20Government%20Dataset%20Analysis)

This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of patent applications and grants using data merged from **four IPO locations** to ensure richer and broader insights. The dataset includes fields like publication dates, invention titles, application types, and more.  
✨ _Additional columns like `Time_to_Grant`, `Filing_Year`, and `Filing_Month` were created to support deeper analysis and meaningful visualizations._

### 🔍 [2. Examination Analysis](https://github.com/reddylaxman/data-analytics-projects/tree/main/2.%20Examination%20Analysis)

This notebook analyzes second-semester midterm marks of students across eight sections (ALPHA to ZETA). The dataset includes marks for core subjects like M-II, PP, BEEE, and FL. Insights include top performers, subject-wise averages, and section comparisons.

---

### 📋 [3. Question Paper Analysis](https://github.com/reddylaxman/data-analytics-projects/tree/main/3.%20Question%20Paper%20Analysis)

This project examines the distribution and scoring of individual questions across mid-semester exam papers. It helps understand which questions were most attempted, most difficult, or poorly answered, providing valuable feedback for educators.

### 🚗 [4. Car Price Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/reddylaxman/data-analytics-projects/tree/main/4.%20Car%20Price%20Dataset%20Analysis)

A regression analysis project that predicts the resale price of cars based on attributes like brand, model, year, mileage, engine size, and ownership history. 

---

### 🚢 [5. Titanic Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/reddylaxman/data-analytics-projects/tree/main/5.%20Titanic%20Dataset%20Analysis)

Using the iconic Titanic dataset, this notebook predicts passenger survival using features like age, class, gender, and fare. The model achieves an accuracy of **0.9775**, with preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation included.
